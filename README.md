# PHSX815_Project2
This repository contains three scripts named:
   1. Radioactive_Decay.ipynb
   2. Likelihood.ipynb
   3. LogLikelihood.ipynb

The first script is used to get the distribution of rate and distribution of radioactive decay. The second scripts is for the likelihood of the
two hypotheses, and third script is for the log likelihood ratio for two different hypotheses.
